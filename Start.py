  FRC Fake Robot Code - SCAVENGER HUNT
===========================================

Welcome, rookie programmers!

This is NOT real robot code — it’s a pretend Python version of a robot program.
Somewhere in this file are HIDDEN CLUES you’ll need to find to complete your scavenger hunt.

Your mission:
1. Read through the code and figure out what each function is supposed to do.
2. Find all the hidden CLUE messages. They might be:
      - In comments (# like this)
      - Inside print statements
      - Inside variables.
3. Put the clues together to solve the final puzzle.

HINT #1:
Start your search in the elevator file!
